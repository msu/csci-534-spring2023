# Computational Geometry Project

All students (even auditors) must participate in a final project.  You may work
in groups with one to four members. Larger groups are allowed with permission.
There are two tracks, you must pick one (see below).  I am happy to participate
in group discussion (even if it is outside of office hours).  Durin the last
third of the semester, we will still have homework assignments, however, the
assignments will be substantially easier to provide you with adequate time to
work on the final project.

To kick off the projects, in class, each team will have a few minutes to
describe what they are working on. Teams can morph and change until the end of
the day specified below.

The project will have two tracks:

* PAPER TRACK: The goal for the project track is to explore an open research
  problem and write a short paper.  The paper should include a problem
  definition and partial results.  Expected length is about 6 pages. There are a
  lot of open problem lists in Computational Geometry around the internet.  For
  example, [The Open Problems Project](https://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/).
  Also feel free to come and speak with me to get additional ideas.
* IMPLEMENTATION TRACK: The goal for the implementation track is to implement a
  geometric algorithm and write a brief report.  You have a lot of freedom.  The
  project can be from class or your own research interest (but still related to
  computational geometry).  You can animate and algorithm or prototype and
  implementation idea.  Again, feel free to come speak with me to get additional
  ideas.

## Dates and Deliverables

* now: Send a direct message on slack or speak with me about a problem that you
  are interested in so that I can point out resources and make sure you are not
  working on something that is too hard or already solved.
* 9 March: (Step 1) In class, present problem description (at most 5 min).
* 28 March: On slack, direct message me a one page outline and plan
  of attack.  At this point, your project groups are fixed.
* April 11: On the course's slack channel post a progress report.
* April 20: First draft (for paper track) / progress report (implementation track)
* May 2-4: 10-15 min presentations
* May 4: Final version of write-up
* May 7 (optional): Canadian Conference in Computational Geometry
        (CCCG) takes short papers. This summer, CCCG is in Halifix Conference
        site: \url{https://projects.cs.dal.ca/cccg2021/}.
